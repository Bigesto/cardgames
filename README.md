Some solo card games, starting with Solitaire.

It is a tiny personnal project, to solidify my understanding of the object oriented projects, then learn how to use Pygame.

Solitaire done! Well... almost, but at least you can play a full game without crashes!

To add in the future:
 - Quit button (back to menu)
 - New game button
 - Scoring
 - Timer
 - Undo button

Should also think to take out the debug renctangles...
